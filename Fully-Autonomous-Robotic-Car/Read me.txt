This code is completely integrated with GPS, Compass Module (I2C communication) and Ultrasonic Sensors to make the robot fully Autonomous. To test the code and make it work with your own robot, follow the steps;

1. For some reasons, my Compass module was not working correctly, so I've to manualy find the angle (in degrees), of the destination point. To do that, first run the code "Set_Compass_head.py" and note down the angle of your destination point. i.e. if your destination point is in centre of North and East, then head the robot towards that position and note down the angle that is printed out in the console. 

2. Once you've got the angle, you need to hardcode the angle on "Code.py", line no 15.

3. And ofcourse, you must change the destination point lat and lng. 

4. Once thats done, you're ready to test your robot. 

Note: if your Compass module is working fine and giving correct angles of the head position, then you'll need to modify your function "GPS()" in the "Raspberry_code.py", such that, currently its only calculatig the distance between your current position and destination points, you'll need to add calculation of finding the head degrees angle between two points aswell.
