# IP-Controlled-Robotic-Car

In this repository, I've added two version of Robot;

Manuall IP Controlled Robotic Car:
    As the name says, we can simply control the robot with our PC keyboard. The communication is done over UDP.  

Fully Autonomous Robotic Car: 
    This code is completely integrated with GPS, Compass Module (I2C communication) and Ultrasonic Sensors. We provide the destination points to the Robot via PC through UDP communication and it then drive its way to that point with collision avoidance. The GUI provides 3 different positions to make the robot move and also have dedicated Start and Stop buttons. To test the code and make it work with your own robot, follow the steps included in the readme of that folder.
